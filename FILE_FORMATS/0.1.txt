tree structure data (binary)
    0 means leaf 1 means branch.
    if you can't understand, read the code!

tree data data
    the character data is lining up by the order of the '0' in structure data (first 0(leaf) node's data is in the first in this section, second 0's data is in the second...)

main data
    look at huffman coding tutorial! so that you can understand
